          Livelihood strategies and programs are crafted based on people's
          strengths, aiming to provide a quality life and achieve sustainable
          living standards. These programs focus on empowering individuals,
          making them resilient to challenges, especially during emergencies
          from a social perspective. People learn to manage external impacts
          independently, without relying on outside support. The goal is to
          adopt sustainable livelihood frameworks and positively influence lives
          in a better way.
