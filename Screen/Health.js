        Health is a complex interplay of economic, epidemiological, demographic, and institutional factors. This variety in healthcare provision can enhance the government's policy leadership and financial responsibility. Among the private sector contributors, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are particularly important. Our organization focuses on the role of NGOs in healthcare: their involvement in delivering and financing health services, their strengths and weaknesses, and public policies to improve their effectiveness in the health sector.
