          In an age of modernization, development, and change, women, alongside
          other societal groups, have stepped up to endorse new strategies that
          aim to create a robust, self-sufficient society. India's development
          has achieved the second highest ranking, a feat that would have been
          impossible without the contributions of women. However, as this is a
          period of transformation, the status of women in India is also
          evolving. To accelerate the growth of women, every part of society
          must come together to support and uplift them.
