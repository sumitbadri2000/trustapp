          The Helping Hand Foundation runs a nationwide initiative focused on
          offering fundamental education to children from disadvantaged
          backgrounds. Education acts as a tool and a goal for improving life
          quality. It equips people with the skills needed for earning a living
          and broadens their understanding of various topicsâ€”ranging from
          healthcare to proper social conduct and recognizing their rights.
          Consequently, this process aids individuals in becoming more
          responsible and informed citizens.
